        <h1 align="center">How to make Tanghulu!</h1>
        <p>Ingridients: <br> - fruit (you can use strawberries, oranges, pineapples, cherries, grapes, etc.)<br> - ice water <br> - sugar <br> - water <br> (make sure to make the sugar to water ratio 2:1!)</p>
        <p>Instructions: First, you make your sugar syrup by mixing your sugar and water on the stove until it turns amber. While the syrup is cooking, put your fruit on a skewer. Once the syrup is ready, dip your fruit skwers into the syrup and cover the fruit with the JUICY syrup. Quickly, take out the skewer from the syrup, then dip it into the bowl of ice water to make the syrup harden. The syrup should harden in 2-3 minutes. After the syrup hardens, the tanghulu is ready. Last and most important step: EAT!</p>
